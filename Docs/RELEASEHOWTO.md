# Before the Release

## A week before the release 

upload the following files to transifex (https://www.transifex.com/yaron/rqdmedia-trans/content/).
Christoph Miebach can give you access if you don't have access yet.

* Root.strings from the en.lproj folder (transifex:ios-settings-2.0)
* infoPlist.strings (English) (transifex:ios-infoplist)
* Localizable.strings (transifex:ios-2.0)

## Manual Testing until we have Unit- and UI-Tests ;) 
Apply the magical patch with all the private keys and client secrets so that you can test cloud integration. Ask J-b or Felix

Make sure that at least the following works:
* The main video controls
* Subtitles
* Chapter and track selection
* Timer and the filters
* Aspect ratio changes
* The cloud integrations, especially login, log out, streaming and downloading
* Wifi up and download
* Local network (twonky server for example)
* Deleting, renaming of files
* Creating, moving in and out of folders

Look at the memory and performance while playing a video
